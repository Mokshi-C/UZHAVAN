# UZHAVAN – Smart Climate-Aware Farming

From guesswork to data-driven farming.

UZHAVAN is a climate-aware agricultural decision support system designed to help small and marginal farmers make informed decisions about crop selection, irrigation, and resource usage using climate trends, soil suitability, and AI-driven insights.

This repository contains the front-end prototype developed for the Zype Hackathon by Team Byteforge.

## Project Overview

A large number of farmers rely on traditional knowledge, local advice, or intuition when making farming decisions. Due to changing climate patterns and lack of access to localized data, this often results in crop failure, increased costs, and environmental degradation.

UZHAVAN addresses this problem by providing a simple, farmer-first digital platform that analyzes climate and soil feasibility and offers practical, region-specific recommendations.

## Core Features

- Climate and seasonal feasibility analysis based on location
- AI-driven crop recommendations with suitability scores
- Soil compatibility and basic soil health indicators
- Water and irrigation optimization guidance
- Actionable advisories and early risk alerts
- Impact dashboard showing estimated savings and sustainability benefits
- Premium soil testing flow (prototype demonstration)

## Front-End Workflow

1. Landing page introducing the problem and solution
2. Farmer details input including location, season, soil type, and irrigation method
3. Climate and soil analysis with visual indicators
4. Crop recommendation screen with expected yield and risk level
5. Advisory and alert screen with actionable suggestions
6. Impact dashboard showing water savings, cost reduction, and soil health improvement
7. Optional premium soil testing booking flow

This workflow demonstrates the end-to-end vision of the system without requiring a complete backend implementation.

## Technology Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 with custom styling and animations
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Light and dark mode support

Note: All climate data and AI outputs are currently simulated for prototype and demonstration purposes.

## User Experience Design

The interface is designed with a farmer-first approach:
- Simple and minimal layout
- Clear step-by-step flow
- Visual indicators instead of complex data tables
- Accessible design suitable for users with basic digital literacy
